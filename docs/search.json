    "text": "Understanding multi-task GPs\nGaussian processes are a powerful tool for regression and classification tasks, offering a non-parametric way to define distributions over functions. When dealing with multiple related outputs, a multi-task GP can model the dependencies between these tasks, leading to better generalization and predictions.\nMathematically, a Gaussian process is defined as a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution. For a set of input points \\(X\\), the corresponding output values \\(f(X)\\) are jointly Gaussian:\n\\[\nf(X) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(m(X), k(X, X))\n\\]\nwhere \\(m(X)\\) is the mean function and \\(k(X, X)\\) is the covariance matrix.\nIn a multitask setting, we aim to model the function \\(f: \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}^T\\), so that we have \\(T\\) outputs, or tasks, \\(\\{f_t(X)\\}_{t=1}^T\\). This means that the mean function is \\(m: \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}^T\\) and the kernel function is \\(k: \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T}\\). How can we model the correlations between these tasks?\n\nIndependent multi-task GP\nA simple independent multioutput GP models each task independently, without considering any correlations between tasks. In this setup, each task has its own GP with its own mean and covariance functions. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\\[\nf_i(X) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(m_i(X), k_i(X, X)) \\qquad i = 1, \\ldots, T,\n\\]\nleading to a block-diagonal covariance matrix \\(k(x, x) = \\text{diag}(k_1(x, x), \\ldots, k_T(x, x))\\). This approach does not leverage any shared information between tasks, which can lead to suboptimal performance, especially when there is limited data for some tasks.\n\n\nIntrinsic model of coregionalization (ICM)\nThe ICM approach generalizes the independent multioutput GP by introducing a coregionalization matrix \\(B\\) that models the correlations between tasks. Specifically, the covariance function in the ICM approach is defined as:\n\\[\nk(x, x') = k_{\\text{input}}(x, x') B,\n\\]\nwhere \\(k_{\\text{input}}\\) is a covariance function defined over the input space (e.g. squared exponential kernel), and \\(B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T}\\) is the coregionalization matrix capturing the task-specific covariances. The matrix \\(B\\) is typically parameterized as \\(B = W W^\\mathsf{T}\\), with \\(W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times r}\\) and \\(r\\) being the rank of the coregionalization matrix. This ensures the kernel is positive semi-definite.\nThe ICM approach can learn the shared structure between tasks. Indeed, the Pearson correlation coefficient between tasks can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\rho_{ij} = \\frac{B[i, j]}{\\sqrt{B[i, i] B[j, j]}}.\n\\]\n\n\nLinear model of coregionalization (LMC)\nAnother common approach is the LMC model, which extends the ICM by allowing for a wider variety of input kernels. In the LMC model, the covariance function is defined as:\n\\[\nk(x, x') = \\sum_{q=1}^Q k_{\\text{input}}^{(q)}(x, x') B_q,\n\\]\nwhere \\(Q\\) is the number of base kernels, \\(k_{\\text{input}}^{(q)}\\) are the base kernels, and \\(B_q\\) are the coregionalization matrices for each base kernel. This model can capture even more complex correlations between tasks by combining multiple base kernels. We can recover the ICM model by setting \\(Q=1\\)."

    "text": "Noise modeling\nIn multi-task GPs, we have to consider a multi-output likelihood function that models the noise for each task. The standard likelihood function is typically a multidimensional Gaussian likelihood, which can be expressed as:\n\\[\ny = f(x) + \\epsilon, \\qquad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}_T(0, \\Sigma),\n\\]\nwhere \\(y\\) is the observed output, \\(f(x)\\) is the latent function, and \\(\\Sigma\\) is the noise covariance matrix. The flexibility is on the choice of the noise covariance matrix, which can be diagonal \\(\\Sigma = \\text{diag}(\\sigma_1^2, \\ldots, \\sigma_T^2)\\) (independent noise for each task) or full (correlated noise across tasks). The latter is usually represented as \\(\\Sigma = L L^\\mathsf{T}\\), where \\(L \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times r}\\) and \\(r\\) is the rank of the noise covariance matrix.

These take care of the multitask structure, the noise and coregionalization matrices, allowing us to focus on the model definition and training.\nRegarding the training loop, it works similarly to standard GPs, with the negative marginal log-likelihood as the loss function, and an optimizer to update the model parameters. A scheduler has been added to reduce the learning rate during training, which can help stabilize the optimization process.\nFigure 2 show the coregionalization matrix \\(B\\) learned by the model, and the noise covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\). The former captures the correlations between the tasks. As we can see, the off-diagonal elements of \\(B\\) are positive. The latter represents the noise levels for each task.

    "section": "Gaussian processes",
    "text": "Gaussian processes\nTo understand Gaussian processes fully, it’s important to briefly mention the Kolmogorov extension theorem. This theorem guarantees the existence of a stochastic process, i.e., a collection of random variables \\(\\{Y_x\\}_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}}, Y_x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), that satisfies a specified finite-dimensional distribution. For instance, it ensures that we can define a Gaussian process by specyfing that any finite set of random variables has a multivariate Gaussian distribution, without worrying about the infinite-dimensional nature of the process. Observe that, in a similar matter, we could define a t-student process, by imposing that finite-dimensional distributions are t-student.\nTherefore, similar to a multivariate Gaussian distribution, a Gaussian process \\(f\\) is defined by its mean function \\(m(\\cdot) : \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) and covariance function \\(k(\\cdot, \\cdot) : \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\):\n\\[\nf \\sim GP(m, k),\n\\]\nand it can be interpreted as an infinite-dimensional generalization of a multivariate Gaussian distribution.\nIn a regression setting, we could use \\(f\\) as a surrogate model of a function \\(g: \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\), where \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) is the input space. Suppose you have a set of input points \\(X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\}\\), with observations \\(Y = \\{y_1 = g(x_1), y_2 = g(x_2), \\ldots, y_n = g(x_n)\\}\\), the joint distribution of the observed outputs \\(Y\\), assuming a GP prior, is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\ny_n\n\\end{pmatrix} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\n\\mathbf{m} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nm(x_1) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nm(x_n)\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\mathbf{K} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nk(x_1, x_1) & \\dots & k(x_1, x_n) \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nk(x_n, x_1) & \\dots & k(x_n, x_n)\n\\end{pmatrix}\\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{m}\\) is the vector of mean function values and \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) is the covariance matrix of the function values at the input points. This approach allows us to make predictions at new input points \\(x_*\\) by conditioning on the observed data, providing not only point estimates but also uncertainty estimates.\n\nMaking predictions\nTo make a prediction \\(y_* = g(x_*)\\) at new input point, we use the joint distribution of the observed outputs \\(Y\\) and the function values at \\(x_*\\), which is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY \\\\\ny_*\n\\end{pmatrix} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{m} \\\\\nm(x_*)\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{K} & k(X, x_*) \\\\\nk(x_*, X) & k(x_*, x_*)\n\\end{pmatrix}\\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(k(x_*, X)\\) is vector of covariances between the new input point \\(x_*\\) and the observed data points \\(X\\). The conditional distribution of \\(y_*\\) given \\(Y\\) is then Gaussian with mean and covariance:\n\\[\n\\mu(x_* \\mid X, Y) = k(x_*, X) \\mathbf{K}^{-1} (Y - \\mathbf{m}),\n\\] \\[\ns^2(x_* \\mid X, Y) = k(x_*, x_*) - k(x_*, X) \\mathbf{K}^{-1} k(X, x_*).\n\\]\nTherefore, given the observed data, we can estimate the function value at a new input point \\(x_*\\) as \\(\\mu(x_*)\\) and quantify the uncertainty in the prediction as \\(s^2(x_*)\\). This is a key advantage of GPs, which can be important in decision-making processes."

    "text": "Interactive visualizations\nLet’s explore some interactive plots to better understand how the kernel functions influence the Gaussian process model. Indeed, the choice of the kernel function is crucial in defining the prior over functions, as it determines the smoothness and periodicity of the functions that the GP can model. Therefore, they play a fundamental role in the model’s flexibility and generalization capabilities, and they can be tailored to the specific characteristics of the data at hand. On the other hand, the mean function is usually set constant, as the kernel is flexible enough.\n\nSquared exponential kernel\nThe squared exponential kernel (also known as the RBF kernel) is defined as:\n\\[\nk_{\\text{Exp}}(x, x') = \\sigma^2 \\exp \\left( -\\frac{(x - x')^2}{2l^2} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance and \\(l\\) is the length scale. Below is an interactive plot that shows how the squared exponential kernel depends on the lengthscale and variance. Notice that with a small length scale, the function is more wiggly. Instead, with a large length scale it is smoother, as the kernel function decays more slowly with distance (i.e., the correlation between faraway points is higher, and they are more similar to each other). Instead, the variance controls the amplitude of the function, with higher values leading to more variability.\n#| standalone: true\n#| viewerHeight: 475\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import multivariate_normal\nfrom shiny import App, render, ui\n\n\n# Define the kernel function\ndef exponential_quadratic_kernel(x1, x2, l=1.0, sigma2=1.0):\n    \"\"\"Computes the exponential quadratic kernel (squared exponential kernel).\"\"\"\n    sqdist = np.sum(x1**2, 1).reshape(-1, 1) + np.sum(x2**2, 1) - 2 * np.dot(x1, x2.T)\n    return sigma2 * np.exp(-0.5 / l**2 * sqdist)\n\n# Define the input space\nX = np.linspace(-4, 4, 100).reshape(-1, 1)\n\ndef plot_kernel_and_samples(l, sigma2):\n    # Compute the kernel matrix\n    K = exponential_quadratic_kernel(X, X, l=l, sigma2=sigma2)\n\n    # Create the plot\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(18, 6), sharex=True)\n\n    # Plot the kernel\n    ax[0].plot(X, exponential_quadratic_kernel(X, np.zeros((1,1)), l=l, sigma2=sigma2))\n    ax[0].set_title(f\"Squared exponential kernel function\")\n\n    # Sample 5 functions from the Gaussian process defined by the kernel\n    mean = np.zeros(100)\n    cov = K\n    samples = multivariate_normal.rvs(mean, cov, 5)\n\n    # Plot the samples\n    for i in range(5):\n        ax[1].plot(X, samples[i])\n    ax[1].set_title(\"Samples from the GP\")\n    ax[1].set_xlabel(\"x\")\n\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    return fig\n\napp_ui = ui.page_fluid(\n    ui.layout_sidebar(\n        ui.panel_sidebar(\n            ui.input_slider(\"length_scale\", \"Length Scale (l):\", min=0.1, max=5.0, value=1.0, step=0.1),\n            ui.input_slider(\"variance\", \"Variance (σ²):\", min=0.1, max=5.0, value=1.0, step=0.1)\n        ),\n        ui.panel_main(\n            ui.output_plot(\"kernelPlot\")\n        )\n    )\n)\n\ndef server(input, output, session):\n    @output\n    @render.plot\n    def kernelPlot():\n        l = input.length_scale()\n        sigma2 = input.variance()\n        fig = plot_kernel_and_samples(l, sigma2)\n        return fig\n\napp = App(app_ui, server)\n\n\nMatérn kernel\nThe Matérn kernel is defined as:\n\\[\nk_{\\text{Matérn}}(x, x') = \\sigma^2 \\frac{2^{1-\\nu}}{\\Gamma(\\nu)} \\left( \\sqrt{2\\nu} \\frac{|x - x'|}{l} \\right)^{\\nu} K_{\\nu} \\left( \\sqrt{2\\nu} \\frac{|x - x'|}{l} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\nu\\) controls the smoothness of the function, \\(l\\) is the length scale, \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance, and \\(K_{\\nu}\\) is the modified Bessel function.

    "text": "Noisy observations\nNoise and measurement error are inevitable in real-world data, which can significantly impact the performance and reliability of predictive models. As a result, it is essential to take noise into account when modeling data with GP. We can represent noisy observations as:\n\\[\ny = g(x) + \\epsilon\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random variable representing the noise. Usually, we assume that \\(\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_n^2)\\), where \\(\\sigma_n^2\\) is the variance of the noise. In this way, it can be easily incorporated into the GP by adding a diagonal noise term to the kernel matrix:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{K}_n = \\mathbf{K} + \\sigma_n^2 \\mathbf{I},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) is the kernel matrix computed on the training data and \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is the identity matrix.\nBelow is an interactive plot that demonstrates how noise influences the GP model. The plot shows the noisy training data (black points) of the true function \\(g(x) = \\sin(x)\\), the red dashed line. The plot also shows the GP mean prediction (blue line) for the squared exponential and Matérn kernels, along with the 95% confidence intervals. For \\(\\sigma_n^2 = 0\\), the model perfectly interpolates the training data. For higher noise levels, the model becomes less certain about the observations, leading to a non-interpolating behavior, and the confidence intervals widen.\n#| standalone: true\n#| viewerHeight: 475\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import multivariate_normal\nfrom shiny import App, render, ui\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cdist\nfrom scipy.special import kv, gamma\n\n# Define the kernel functions\ndef exponential_quadratic_kernel(x1, x2, l=1.0, sigma2=1.0):\n    \"\"\"Computes the exponential quadratic kernel (squared exponential kernel).\"\"\"\n    sqdist = np.sum(x1**2, 1).reshape(-1, 1) + np.sum(x2**2, 1) - 2 * np.dot(x1, x2.T)\n    return sigma2 * np.exp(-0.5 / l**2 * sqdist)\n\ndef matern_kernel(x1, x2, l=1.0, sigma2=1.0, nu=1.5):\n    \"\"\"Computes the Matérn kernel.\"\"\"\n    D = cdist(x1, x2, 'euclidean')\n    const = (2**(1-nu))/gamma(nu)\n    K = sigma2 * const * (np.sqrt(2*nu)*D/l)**nu * kv(nu, np.sqrt(2*nu)*D/l)\n    # Replace NaN values with 1 for x == x'\n    K[np.isnan(K)] = 1\n    return K\n\n# Define the input space\nX = np.linspace(-4, 4, 100).reshape(-1, 1)\n\ndef plot_kernels_and_samples(noise_level):\n    # Generate training data with noise\n    X_train = np.array([-3, -2, -1, 1, 3.5]).reshape(-1, 1)\n    y_train = np.sin(X_train) + noise_level * np.random.randn(X_train.shape[0], 1).reshape(-1,1)\n\n    # Compute the kernel matrices for training data\n    K_train_exp = exponential_quadratic_kernel(X_train, X_train) + noise_level**2 * np.eye(len(X_train))\n    K_s_exp = exponential_quadratic_kernel(X_train, X)\n    K_ss_exp = exponential_quadratic_kernel(X, X)\n    \n    K_train_matern = matern_kernel(X_train, X_train) + noise_level**2 * np.eye(len(X_train))\n    K_s_matern = matern_kernel(X_train, X)\n    K_ss_matern = matern_kernel(X, X)\n\n    # Compute the mean and covariance of the posterior distribution for exponential kernel\n    K_train_inv_exp = np.linalg.inv(K_train_exp)\n    mu_s_exp = (K_s_exp.T.dot(K_train_inv_exp).dot(y_train)).reshape(-1)\n    cov_s_exp = K_ss_exp - K_s_exp.T.dot(K_train_inv_exp).dot(K_s_exp)\n\n    # Compute the mean and covariance of the posterior distribution for Matérn kernel\n    K_train_inv_matern = np.linalg.inv(K_train_matern)\n    mu_s_matern = (K_s_matern.T.dot(K_train_inv_matern).dot(y_train)).reshape(-1)\n    cov_s_matern = K_ss_matern - K_s_matern.T.dot(K_train_inv_matern).dot(K_s_matern)\n\n    # Sample 5 functions from the posterior distribution for both kernels\n    samples_exp = multivariate_normal.rvs(mu_s_exp, cov_s_exp, 5)\n    samples_matern = multivariate_normal.rvs(mu_s_matern, cov_s_matern, 5)\n\n    # Create the plot\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(18, 6), sharex=True)\n\n    # Plot the training data and GP predictions for exponential kernel\n    ax[0].scatter(X_train, y_train, color='black', zorder=10, label='Noisy observations')\n    ax[0].plot(X, mu_s_exp, color='blue', label='Mean prediction')\n    ax[0].plot(X, np.sin(X), color='r', linestyle='--', label='True function')\n    ax[0].fill_between(X.ravel(), mu_s_exp - 1.96 * np.sqrt(np.diag(cov_s_exp)), mu_s_exp + 1.96 * np.sqrt(np.diag(cov_s_exp)), color=\"blue\", alpha=0.2, label='Confidence interval')\n    # for i in range(5):\n    #     ax[0].plot(X, samples_exp[i], alpha=0.5, linestyle='--')\n    ax[0].set_title(f\"Squared exponential kernel\")\n    # ax[0].legend()\n\n    # Plot the training data and GP predictions for Matérn kernel\n    ax[1].scatter(X_train, y_train, color='black', zorder=10, label='Noisy observations')\n    ax[1].plot(X, mu_s_matern, color=\"blue\", label='Mean prediction')\n    ax[1].plot(X, np.sin(X), color=\"r\", linestyle='--', label='True function')\n    ax[1].fill_between(X.ravel(), mu_s_matern - 1.96 * np.sqrt(np.diag(cov_s_matern)), mu_s_matern + 1.96 * np.sqrt(np.diag(cov_s_matern)), color=\"blue\", alpha=0.2, label='Confidence interval')\n    # for i in range(5):\n    #     ax[1].plot(X, samples_matern[i], alpha=0.5, linestyle='--')\n    ax[1].set_title(f\"Matérn kernel\")\n    # ax[1].legend()\n    ax[1].set_xlabel(\"x\")\n\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    return fig\n\napp_ui = ui.page_fluid(\n    ui.layout_sidebar(\n        ui.panel_sidebar(\n            ui.input_slider(\"noise_level\", \"Noise Level (σ²ₙ):\", min=0.0, max=1.0, value=0.0, step=0.01)\n        ),\n        ui.panel_main(\n            ui.output_plot(\"kernelPlot\")\n        )\n    )\n)\n\ndef server(input, output, session):\n    @output\n    @render.plot\n    def kernelPlot():\n        noise_level = input.noise_level()\n        fig = plot_kernels_and_samples(noise_level)\n        return fig\n\napp = App(app_ui, server)"

Observe that the base kernel is the RBFKernel, which corresponds to the squared exponential kernel, and it is wrapped by the ScaleKernel to allow for the scaling of the kernel through the variance parameter \\(\\sigma^2\\). The ExactMarginalLogLikelihood object is used to compute the marginal log likelihood, which is the negative loss function for training the GP model. Indeed, the GP model parameters are optimized by maximizing the marginal log likelihood of the observed data, which is given by\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\log p(Y \\mid X, \\theta)\n    = -\\frac{1}{2} (Y - \\mathbf{m})^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{K}_n^{-1} (Y - \\mathbf{m}) - \\frac{1}{2} \\log |\\mathbf{K}_n| - \\frac{N}{2} \\log(2\\pi),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) are the model parameters, comprising the mean, kernel, and likelihood parameters. Computaionally speaking, the inversion of the kernel matrix \\(\\mathbf{K}_n\\) is the most expensive operation, with a complexity of \\(\\mathcal{O}(N^3)\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of training points. Therefore, for very large datasets, approximate inference methods, inducing points, or sparse GPs should be used to reduce the computational burden.\nLastly, observe that the ExactGP class is the standard GP for Gaussian likelihoods, where the exact marginal log likelihood can be computed in closed form. However, GPyTorch also provides different likelihoods, such as student-t likelihoods (which is more stable if outliers are present) and more. In these cases, the must class ApproximateGP should be used, which allows for approximate inference methods like variational inference. Regarding the loss function, the ExactMarginalLogLikelihood should be replaced by the VariationalELBO object, or other appropriate loss functions for approximate inference."

Finding the optimal combination of hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, and units per layer, can significantly enhance a model’s performance. Traditional methods like grid search and random search often prove to be inefficient and computationally expensive. This is where Bayesian optimization, powered by GPs, comes into play, offering a smarter approach to hyperparameter tuning.\nUnlike exhaustive search methods, Bayesian optimization is more sample-efficient, meaning it can find optimal hyperparameters with fewer iterations. It works by\n\nmodeling the objective function (e.g., validation loss) as a GP in the hyperparameter space.\nusing an acquisition function to decide where to sample next. The acquisition function balances exploration (sampling in unexplored regions) and exploitation (sampling in regions with low loss) to guide the search towards the global optimum.\n\n\n\nTime series forecasting\nGPs are also widely used in time series forecasting due to their flexibility and ability to model complex patterns in the data. By treating time series data as a function of time, Gaussian processes can capture the underlying dynamics and dependencies in the series. They can provide not only point estimates but also probabilistic forecasts, including prediction intervals that quantify uncertainty."
